# 👋 Hi, I'm Balaji | Software Engineer | Systems • Backend • AI

I’m a Software Engineer with 2+ years of experience building **high‑performance systems**, **backend services**, and **AI‑driven automation**.  
My work bridges **embedded engineering**, **distributed systems**, and **applied machine learning** — I love solving problems that require both low‑level precision and large‑scale architectural thinking.

Currently pursuing my **MSc in Artificial Intelligence at Dublin City University**, while building projects that combine systems engineering with modern AI capabilities.
